/**
 * <p>
 * A class to facilitate counting objects and sorting them based on their
 * frequency. The counter has an ID (the object) and a count, which stores the
 * number of multiples or instances of the object that have been counted.
 * Increment, decrement, and setCount methods allow the count to be changed. The
 * class implements Comparable to facilitate sorting. The natural order is
 * defined to be *decreasing* with higher frequency, so Arrays.sort() applied to
 * an array of FrequencyCounter[] will sort the array from high to low count.
