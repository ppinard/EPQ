/**
 * <p>
 * The TabulatedInelasticSM differs from earlier implementations of
 * ScatterMechanism in that most of the properties of the scattering are not
 * hard coded into the object, but rather are dictated by input tables. So, for
 * example, the inverse mean free path for this mechanism is determined by
 * interpolating an IIMFP table associated with the material. The distribution
 * of energy losses and angle changes by the primary electron are similarly
 * determined by tables. In this way, almost all of the physics of the
 * scattering is contained in the tables, and the scatter mechanism object is
 * itself almost without physics content.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The tables are provided to the constructor via an array of strings, each of
 * which contains the full path to a file that can serve as input to construct a
 * NUTableInterpolation object. The required tables are documented in the
 * constructor notes. For 3 of the tables, the first input parameter is the
 * kinetic energy of the primary electron. By default, this kinetic energy is
 * assumed to be the PE's energy with respect to the bottom of the conduction
 * band. Sometimes, however, tables use a different convention. For example, in
 * a semiconductor or insulator tables may be computed for energies measured
 * with respect to the bottom of the valence band (the highest occupied band).
 * This can be accommodated by providing the constructor with the energy offset
 * between these two definitions of energy. That is, Eoffset = (energy of
 * conduction band bottom) - (the energy defined as the zero for purpose of the
 * tables).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is, however, an exception to the above generalizations. There remains
 * some uncertainty in the literature over the connection between primary
 * electron energy loss/trajectory change on the one hand and secondary electron
 * (SE) final energy/final trajectory on the other. Part of the reason for this
 * difference lies in varying assumptions about the initial (pre-scattering)
 * energy and trajectory of the SE. Some of the different methods of treating
 * this connection have been implemented in this class. One of them must be
 * selected to instantiate an object of this class. The selection is made by
 * choosing a value for the methodSE parameter in the constructor. Following are
 * the methods that have been implemented:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * methodSE = 1: This selection is an implementation of the method described by
 * Ding & Shimizu in SCANNING 18 (1996) p. 92. If the PE energy loss, deltaE is
 * greater than a core level binding energy, the SE final energy is
 * deltaE-Ebinding. Otherwise, it is deltaE+EFermi, where EFermi is the Fermi
 * energy of the material. The final direction of the SE is determined from
 * conservation of momentum with the assumption that the SE initial momentum was
 * 0.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * methodSE = 2: This selection is an implementation of the method described by
 * Ding, Tang, & Shimizu in J.Appl.Phys. 89 (2001) p. 718. If deltaE is greater
 * than a core level binding energy the treatment is the same as methodSE = 1.
 * If not, the SE final energy is deltaE + E'. If E' were the Fermi energy this
 * would be the same as methodSE = 1. However, E' lies in the range max(0,EFermi
 * - deltaE) <= E' <= EFermi. The value of E' is determined probabilistically
 * based upon the free electron densities of occupied and unoccupied states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * methodSE = 3: This selection is my modified version of the method described
 * by Mao et al. in J.Appl.Phys. 104 (2008) article #114907. The scattering
 * event is assigned as either an electron-electron event or an electron-plasmon
 * event based upon the momentum transfer. Plasmon events are treated as in
 * methodSE = 2, except that the SE direction is isotropic. Electron-electron
 * events have energy and direction determined as described by Mao et al.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Interpolation is implemented using the NUTableInterpolation class. That class
 * natively allows extrapolation, but TabulatedInelasticSM checks input
 * parameters and forbids it. This means the user-provided tables must cover the
 * full range of energies that will be encountered in the simulation. This
 * generally means the tables that take PE energy as one of the inputs should
 * cover energies from the material's Fermi energy up to at least the energy of
 * electrons generated by the electron gun.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scattering mechanism uses the following material properties, which
 * therefore need to be properly defined: coreEnergy array, energyCBbottom,
 * bandgap, and workfunction.
