/**
 * ChargingListener is used to simulate the effect of charging. It keeps an
 * account of charge accumulation or depletion within MeshedRegions,
 * periodically performs finite element analysis (FEA) to compute the resulting
 * electrostatic potentials and fields, and corrects electron trajectories and
 * energies accordingly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The frequency of FEA solutions is determined by the user-supplied
 * solnInterval parameter. The ChargingListener maintains a count of
 * trajectories run since the last solution. When this count equals
 * solnInterval, a new FEA solution is computed. At any given time, the fields
 * are approximated by the values determined at the most recently completed
 * solution. Choice of solnInterval is a trade-off: Smaller values lead to more
 * frequent and hence more accurate solutions, but FEA solutions can be
 * time-consuming.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ChargingListener performs FEA solutions by using an IFEARunner. The
 * IFEArunner tells ChargingListener how to run finite element analysis when
 * needed. Typical implementations provide a number of user-settable parameters
 * that determine how the solution is to be performed. The parameters determine
 * such things as the type of solver or preconditioner, convergence criteria,
 * etc. The values of the parameters affect whether the FEA solution converges
 * and the amount of time for convergence. Parameters that permit convergence
 * under the widest possible set of circumstances can cause solutions to be
 * needlessly time-consuming. ChargingListener employs a set of defaults that
 * seem to provide a reasonable compromise between speed and generality. If your
 * problem fails to converge it may benefit from altered settings (e.g., higher
 * quality preconditioner). On the other hand, naturally well-conditioned
 * problems might run faster with altered settings (e.g., faster, low quality
 * preconditioner). Setters and getters for these parameters are provided by
 * ChargingListener. A description of the function of each parameter may be
 * found in the documentation for these methods. For additional details, see
 * Sparskit documentation available on the web.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the constructor, set feaInitializationRequired = true if you need an FEA
 * solution to be computed at N = 0 (i.e., before any electron trajectories are
 * run). You would use this, for example, if your mesh has initial nonzero
 * charge densities in some regions or if it contains conducting regions held at
 * nonzero potentials and you have not already computed and imported the
 * solution for the resulting fields. If the sample is initially uncharged and
 * field-free (the state assumed when you import a mesh) then it is not
 * necessary to run an FEA at N = 0. In this case either set
 * feaInitializationRequired = false in the constructor or use the provided form
 * of the constructor for which this is the default setting.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ChargingListener can be set to log the charge & potential state of the mesh
 * to a file each cycle. The user calls setCPlog(), supplying the path to a
 * destination folder. Log files are generated internally using the
 * mesh.exportChargeAndPotentials method (see this method documentation for
 * details). The files are called cp[n].dat, with n starting with 1 and
 * incremented each time a log file is written. Logging is off by default. After
 * it is turned on by a call to setCPlog() it may be turned off again by calling
 * the stopCPlog() method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since the user supplies the mesh upon which this calculation is based, it may
 * be useful to consider how approximations employed by JMONSEL depend upon the
 * size of mesh elements. The FEA uses a linear approximation for potentials
 * within tetrahedral mesh elements. This means the electric field is constant
 * within each element. Charges deposited within a mesh element are assumed to
 * be uniformly distributed. I.e., the charge density is constant within each
 * element. Trajectories are corrected using Euler's approximation assuming
 * constant acceleration. Cumulative errors in Euler's approximation scale
 * linearly with element size. The scale is set by the electron's kinetic
 * energy. Trajectories should be accurate if the mesh elements are chosen
 * everywhere small enough that the difference between the maximum and minimum
 * potential energy within the element is small compared to the electron's
 * kinetic energy. Of course, the electron's kinetic energy eventually tends to
 * 0, so trajectories can never be accurate at the end of the electron's range.
 * However, the error in the electron's stopping position (which determines the
 * charge distribution) then depends upon the electron's remaining range. This
 * is small when the electron's energy is small. A reasonable starting
 * hypothesis would be to keep mesh elements small enough so that potential
 * differences across a mesh element are less than 1 volt. To keep memory and
 * computation time within reasonable limits, it is generally necessary to use a
 * variable mesh element size. Obviously, the most critical places to have small
 * mesh elements will be in the neighborhood of charges, and within those
 * neighborhoods the most critical are those near features of interest.

   /**
    * <p>
    * A class to represent the differential equations that describe currents in
    * RCConnections. The differential equations are int the form qdot[i] = -
    * deltaV[i]/(p*tau(deltaV[i])) where q[i] is the charge flowed on the ith RC
    * connection, qdot[i] is its time derivative, deltaV[i] is the potential
    * drop across the ith connection, tau(deltaV[i]) is the time constant
    * associated with this connection, and p is the reciprocal of a capacitance
    * associated with the connection.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * deltaV is determined from a matrix equation of the form deltaV = Vprev +
    * coefficientsChargesFromBeam.Q + coefficientsChargesFromCurrent.q where
    * Vprev is the voltage across the connections at last FEA, Q are new charges
    * on the floating regions since the last FEA and q is the amount of charge
    * in the connections since the last FEA. The quantities are all vectors or
    * matrices and "." means matrix multiplication. q is a vector of length
    * equal to the number of connections (the dimension of the problem). Q is a
    * vector of length equal to the number of floating regions involved in the
    * connections. Since connections may involve 1 or 2 floating regions Q will
    * have length greater than or equal to q's length.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * The calling routine need not (and cannot) supply all of the constants in
    * these equations. Some of them, e.g., the p constant in the denominator and
    * the matrices, are determined by FEA by the constructor. The voltages at
    * the last FEA are likewise determined internally. After construction, the
    * only remaining parameter that the calling routine must supply to set up
    * the equations before solving is the Q vector--the average charges on
    * floating regions not due to charge flows in the connections (e.g., charges
    * directly from the beam) that have appeared in the interval since the
    * previous FEA. The calling routine supplies this vector by calling setV0().
    * ConnectionCurrentsODE then uses these charges to determine the initial
    * voltages on the connections.
