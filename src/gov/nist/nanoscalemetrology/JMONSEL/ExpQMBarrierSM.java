/**
 * <p>
 * Implements quantum mechanical scattering from a finite-width barrier with
 * "exponential" shape. I.e., the form of the potential energy barrier is
 * assumed to be U(x) = deltaU/(1+Exp(-2*x/lambda)). This barrier function
 * represents a smooth s-shaped transition from U(x)=0 well to the left of the
 * barrier to U(x)=deltaU well to the right. lambda is a measure of the width of
 * the barrier. Roughly half (~46%) of the transition occurs over a distance
 * equal to lambda (from x = -lambda/2 to x = lambda/2), 90% over 3*lambda.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is an analytical formula for the probability of barrier transmission
 * through such a barrier. (See, e.g., Landau &amp; Lifshitz, Quantum Mechanics,
 * 1958, pg. 75.) This class computes barrier transmission using that formula.
 * In the limit that lambda is "large," this probability approaches the
 * classical result. In the limit that lambda goes to 0, it approaches the
 * transmission probability for sharp barriers encountered in elementary quantum
 * mechanics texts. For most purposes the useful range of lambda values is from
 * 0 m to 1.E-9 m. Anything larger than this is essentially classical.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A barrier scattering mechanism is associated with each region of our sample,
 * but barrier transmission is a pair-wise phenomenon. That is, the barrier
 * height and width at an interface between materials A and B depends in
 * principle upon the properties of both materials. If the electron starts
 * inside material A, then it is material A's barrier scatter mechanism that
 * governs that particular scattering event. The present scatter mechanism
 * determines the barrier height by comparing the potential energies in the
 * materials on each side of the interface. It uses the barrier width associated
 * with material A.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is therefore a somewhat general implementation of barrier scattering
 * that includes classical and sharp-barrier quantum mechanical scattering as
 * special cases. Two constructors are provided. Both constructors accept a
 * material as input (from which the barrier height is determined). One
 * constructor additionally allows specification of lambda. The other does not.
 * The constructor without lambda specification implements classical barrier
 * scattering (the large lambda limit). This method of implementing classical
 * barrier scattering is preferred to giving an explict but large value of
 * lambda because it uses a simpler limiting-case formula, and it avoids
 * possible numerical issues associated with large arguments. The constructor
 * with an explicit lambda specification implements quantum mechanical
 * scattering for a barrier of the specified width.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This scattering mechanism uses the following material properties, which
 * therefore need to be properly defined for the materials on both sides of the
 * interface: energyCBbottom.

/*
 * A classical model may be more applicable than one might think. The
 * significance of quantum mechanical effects for SE yield is mitigated by two
 * factors. First, the strength of the effect depends upon how quickly the
 * potential energy transitions between its levels in the two materials. An
 * infinitely sharp transition, which is easy to solve and produces the usual
 * quantum mechanical transmission formula, is unrealistic. As the barrier width
 * increases, the quantum mechanical result quickly approaches the classical
 * limit. By 1 nm, there is little discernible difference. Secondly, quantum
 * mechanical effects are energy dependent, and the electrons encountering the
 * barrier are distributed in energy. Averaging over the distribution suggests
 * at most a 10% yield difference between an infinitely sharp barrier and a
 * barrier wide enough to be in the classical limit.
