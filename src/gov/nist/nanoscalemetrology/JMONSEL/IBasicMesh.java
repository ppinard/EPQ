 * The raw data of a mesh consist of a list of nodes (x,y,z coordinates), each
 * with an associated electrostatic potential and a list of mesh elements: lines
 * (joining two nodes), triangles (3 ordered nodes), and tetrahedra (4 ordered
 * nodes). The order of nodes in a triangle is such that the nodes are clockwise
 * when viewed from inside, counterclockwise from outside. For a tetrahedron,
 * any node may be given first. The remaining 3 are then given in clockwise
 * order as viewed from the first. Each element has an element type: 1 for line,
 * 2 for triangle, 4 for tetrahedron. It also has a list of integer tags and a
 * list of node indices. An IBasicMesh provides methods to access these data.
