/**
 * <p>
 * A class used to import, store, and access a mesh. Presently, only tetrahedral
 * meshes are supported. Two versions of the constructor are supplied. The more
 * general one takes an IBasicMesh object as input and uses it to construct the
 * Mesh. For example, the GmshMesh class implements IBasicMesh for meshes
 * created by the open source Gmsh program. Other IBasicMesh implementations may
 * be written for other meshing routines. The second constructor takes a string
 * which it uses to generate a GmshMesh by reading the Gmsh mesh file. The
 * IBasicMesh object at the core of Mesh provides most of the functionality
 * related to geometry and connectivity--the things a mesh needs to do for a
 * finte element analysis program. This Mesh class adds the functionality needed
 * for performing simulations on meshes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The raw data of a mesh consist of a list of nodes (x,y,z coordinates), each
 * with an associated electrostatic potential and a list of mesh elements: lines
 * (joining two nodes), triangles (3 ordered nodes), and tetrahedra (4 ordered
 * nodes). The order of nodes in a triangle is such that the nodes are clockwise
 * when viewed from inside, counterclockwise from outside. For a tetrahedron,
 * any node may be given first. The remaining 3 are then given in clockwise
 * order as viewed from the first. Each element has an element type: 1 for line,
 * 2 for triangle, 4 for tetrahedron. It also has a list of integer tags and a
 * list of node indices. Mesh provides methods to access these data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Characteristic of a mesh is that faces of volume elements are shared between
 * at most two volume elements. Thus, each tetrahedron in the mesh has
 * well-defined neighbors. This characteristic makes possible efficient
 * determination of which element of the mesh contains a given point or which
 * element is the next one when a trajectory intersects the boundary of a given
 * element. These capabilities are made accessible via implementation of
 * nextTet() and containingShape() methods specified by a "ConnectedShape"
 * interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Mesh provides a number of subclasses--Element(abstract), Line, Triangle, and
 * Tetrahedron--that are used to instantiate objects that represent components
 * of the mesh. It also provides a MeshShape class that represents the overall
 * shape of the meshed region and a getMeshShape() method that returns the
 * MeshShape for this mesh. The MeshShape is the shape that corresponds to the
 * boundary of the mesh. This shape is mainly useful when the mesh is viewed
 * from the outside, e.g., when it is necessary to decide whether a trajectory
 * that begins outside the mesh intersects the mesh somewhere or whether a point
 * is contained somewhere within the mesh. Viewed from the inside, a trajectory
 * always moves from one tetrahedral element to another, so the mesh looks like
 * a series of connected tetrahedra.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Mesh elements (lines, triangles, tetrahedra) may not be rotated or translated
 * individually. The mesh as a whole can, however, either by using its rotate()
 * and translate() methods or by using its MeshShape's rotate() and translate().
 * (The latter simply call the former.) These methods transform all of the nodes
 * in the mesh. Mesh elements frequently internally cache geometrical
 * information for better performance. Any such cache must be updated after the
 * mesh is transformed. All Tetrahedrons and any nonTetrahedrons that Mesh has
 * created for its own use (e.g., the list of triangular facets that define the
 * MeshShape's boundary) are known to Mesh and are automatically updated as part
 * of the rotation or transformation. If you have created any other
 * nonTetrahedrons for your use, Mesh does not know about them and it does not
 * update them when the mesh is rotated or translated. You must do this
 * yourself, using the updateGeom() method provided for each of them.
