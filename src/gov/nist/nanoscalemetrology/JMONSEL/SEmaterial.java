/**
 * <p>
 * An extension of the EPQLibrary Material class to include MONSEL-style
 * material properties relevant for secondary electron generation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Various physical scattering models require different material properties.
 * Getters and setters allow storing and accessing this information. Elemental
 * composition and the density of the material are available from the parent
 * class. Additional properties made available by this extension include the
 * material work function, plasmon energy, the location of the conduction band
 * minimum, and electronic structure of the material in the form of a
 * representation of the density of states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The density of states is represented by lists of discrete state energy
 * values, their corresponding kinetic energies, and their occupancies. The
 * energy values are stored as "binding" energies, i.e., positive values equal
 * to the distance of the specified state below the vacuum level, which is taken
 * as having energy = 0. Thus the binding energy is the negative of the total
 * energy associated with a state. The corresponding densities are the number of
 * electrons per cubic meter that occupy the specified state. A crude
 * approximation of an energy band might be a single state with energy in the
 * middle of the band and density reflecting ALL of the electrons in the band.
 * If desired, the approximation can be refined, possibly at the cost of slowing
 * the simulation, by dividing the density appropriately among a larger number
 * of energy states.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For some models, scattering cross sections depend upon the target electron's
 * kinetic energy and not simply upon its total energy. To facilitate these
 * models, kinetic energies are associated with each of the states. These
 * energies may be supplied by the user (e.g., based upon literature values or
 * the user's own model for the material). If they are not supplied by the user,
 * default values are supplied. For electrons in the conduction band (energy
 * above the conduction band minimum) the default algorithm assigns a kinetic
 * energy equal to the distance of the state above the band minimum. For
 * electrons at lower levels the default algorithm assigns a kinetic energy
 * equal to the distance of the state below the vacuum level. The virial theorem
 * provides the rationale for this latter choice. It is believed that this
 * choice should be accurate for core levels, which are localized and atom-like.
 * This choice is probably more dubious for lightly bound states, such as those
 * in the valence band, but as I am not aware of a general procedure that
 * applies to all materials this seems as reasonable a default procedure as any.
 * You, the user, are supposed to know your material. You are encouraged to
 * override the defaults if you have better information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the SEmaterial class's job is to make these material properties
 * available to models. The models themselves decide which properties to use and
 * how to use them.

    * to expend time getting past them to the next unique entry; thus use of
